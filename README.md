The image is a screenshot of a web application running locally in a browser (127.0.0.1:5500/index.html). The application is titled “Smart Indian Bus Route System” and has a bus emoji icon next to the title.
🔹 Interface Layout:
Two dropdown menus at the top for selecting cities:
From: Chennai
To: Bangalore
A third dropdown to select the bus type (Ordinary Bus).
A “Get Bus Details” button below the dropdowns.
🔹 Displayed Bus Information:
After clicking the button, the app shows:
Bus Name: TN Super Fast
Bus Number: TN-01-1234
Distance: 327.75 km
Estimated Time: 4.18 hours
Fare: ₹491.63
🔹 Map Section:
At the bottom, there is an embedded interactive map (likely using OpenStreetMap/Leaflet), showing a large view of India and surrounding regions. The map includes zoom controls on the left side.
🔹 Overall Impression:
This appears to be a student or demo web project that calculates and displays bus route details (distance, time, and fare) between selected Indian cities along with a map visualization.

)
*This image shows the lower section of a web application displaying an interactive digital map.
🔹 Map View
The map is centered over India, showing surrounding regions including parts of:
The Middle East (left side)
South Asia
Southeast Asia (right side)
Major Indian cities like Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and others are visible.
State boundaries and terrain features (green areas for forests/elevation) are shown.
🔹 Map Controls
A zoom control (+ / −) is visible on the top-left corner.
The bottom-right corner shows the Leaflet watermark, indicating the map is built using the Leaflet.js mapping library.
🔹 System Environment
The bottom portion of the screenshot includes the Windows taskbar:
Weather widget showing 22°C, Mostly sunny
System time 10:54
Date 21-02-2026
Language indicator ENG
🔹 Overall Context
This appears to be part of a bus route system project interface where the map visually represents routes across India, likely to display travel paths between selected cities.*
